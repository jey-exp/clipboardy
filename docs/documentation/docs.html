                <p>Welcome to the Clipboardy documentation. This guide will help you navigate the features and
                    functionality of Clipboardy, along with tutorials on installation and contributing via GitHub.</p>
                <strong>Note: Installation assumes basic familiarity with programming and GitHub.</strong>

                <h2>Saving Clipboards</h2>
                <h3>Encryption/Decryption</h3>
                <p>All your saved clips (clipboard entries) will be encrypted for safety and automatically decrypted
                    when showing them to you. View the "clips.json" file in the "package" folder to see all your clips
                    in raw json as they are encrypted.
                </p>

                <h3>Auto Save</h3>
                <p>By toggeling the "Auto Save" switch in the buttom right corner, you can allow Clipboardy to
                    read and compare each of your clips to save them automatically for you.
                </p>

                <h3>Functions</h3>
                <p>Next to the saved clip in the main window are two buttons, the first one beeing for coping the
                    clip again and the second one to delete the clip. To delete all clips, press the "Delete All" button
                    in the buttom section.
                </p>

                <h3>Searching and filtering</h3>
                <p>The searchbar allows you to search specific clips by thier name. The filter function is still
                    in development and will be released soon.
